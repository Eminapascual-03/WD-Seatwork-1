## Overview

<!-- The following are just sample -->
This project is our first activity in Web Design, consisting of one main layout with a header and footer, and includes five unique designs for both headers and footers. The purpose is to practice using HTML and CSS to build and style web pages, learn how to reuse common webpage parts, and show creativity in designing layouts, buttons, and colors. Key components include the main layout, animated buttons, and multiple custom designs for both headers and footers. HTML5 was used to create the structure of the pages, including text, buttons, and images, while CSS3 was used to style the layout with colors, spacing, fonts, shadows, and animations to enhance the overall design.


### Key Components
<!-- The following are just sample -->

- Single Page Website

## Rules, Practices and Principles
1. Always use `WD-` in the front of the Title of the Project for the Subject followed by your custom naming.
2. Do not rename any .html files; always use `index.html` as the filename.
3. Place Files in their respective folders.
4. All file naming are in camel case.
   - Camel case is naming format where there is no white space in separation of each words, the first word is in all lower case while the succeding words first letter are in upper followed by lower cased letters.
   - ex.: buttonAnimatedStyle.css
5. Use only `External CSS`.
6. Renaming of Pages folder names are a must, and relates to what it is doing or data it holding.
7. File Structure to follow below.

```
